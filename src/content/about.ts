  /**
   * DRAFTED FROM VERIFIED EVIDENCE — please rewrite in your own voice.

   * Every statement below is checkable: the degrees are confirmed, the PhD
   * platform is live and its architecture was read from the repository, the
   * Zara/Flask/PHP details come from those repositories, and "undergraduate
   * final year" is the library repo's own GitHub description. Nothing here is
   * invented — but the phrasing is mine, and it should sound like you.

  biography: [
    'I am an MCA student at Periyar University, and most of what I know came from building things other people then had to use. The largest of those is the university’s own PhD admission platform — four separate portals over one MySQL database — which now runs in production for its research admissions.',
    'The rest of my work spans the stack rather than one corner of it: a React and TypeScript AI workspace built against Gemini and Groq, a scikit-learn classifier served through Flask, and a PHP records system from my undergraduate final year. Different languages, the same habit — get the data model right first, then make the interface honest about it.',
